The cluster:
We have set up a local hadoop cluster comprised of 5 desktop machines with the following specs:
- Intel Xeon quad-core processors
- 32Gb memory each
- Fairly old 512GB SSD disks
- Running CentOS 7.7

The cluster is running Apache Ambari (https://ambari.apache.org/) for cluster management. 
There is one NameNode and four DataNodes, and the installed services include: HDFS, YARN, MapReduce2, Hive, Spark2 (v 2.3.1), Zeppelin and others.

We will be accessing the cluster through Zeppelin notebooks and using the PySpark API.
The Zeppelin webinterface (which is running on the NameNode) can be reached at http://130.226.142.166:9995
